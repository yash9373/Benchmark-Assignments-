2. Dashboard with API Data (GET Endpoints)
Display statistics (total users, companies, roles, etc.) on the dashboard.
Fetch data using TanStack Query (React Query) to optimize API calls.
Use Zustand for global state management to store user authentication details.
3. User Management
List all users (GET /users).
Show user details by clicking on a user (GET /users/{user_id}).
Implement a search bar with useState for filtering users.
Store the selected user in Context API to avoid refetching.
4. Company Management
Display all companies (GET /companies).
Show company details (GET /companies/{company_id}).
Allow users to filter companies by market capital.
Use useReducer to manage filtering and sorting state.
5. CRUD Operations
Implement React Hook Form for adding/editing users and companies.
Use Axios for API calls.
Implement a toast notification system for success/error messages.
6. Role-Based Access
Fetch roles (GET /roles) and filter user actions based on roles.
Use Zustand to store the logged-in user's role.
7. Blog & Comments Section
List all posts (GET /posts).
View a post by ID (GET /posts/{post_id}).
List comments for a post (GET /comments).
Show comment details (GET /comments/{comment_id}).
